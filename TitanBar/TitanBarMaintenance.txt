You can download the newest version of the code from GitHub:

All files are encoded in ANSI. 
Some of them were encoded as UTF-8 at some point but I had some interesting results while using them (didn't pick up reputation gain as an example). 
I converted them back to ANSI because of that.
Because the files are encoded in ANSI you have to use code for special characters. You can find the most commonly used in the "code.txt" file.
I used the following page to get the code for different characters: https://www.utf8-chartable.de/
Some text editors (Notepad++...) automatically convert ANSI files to UTF-8. I recommend to turn that feature off while working on then Plugin.
For Notepad++ go to Settings -> Preferences -> New Document -> Remove the checkmark by "Apply to opened ANSI files".


Adding a new reputation faction:
- Add the faction text names to the 'de', 'en', and 'fr' localization files (Important: Excatly as they are written in the game, otherwise it won't work)
-- Search for "All reputation names" and add the new name to the end of the existing list
-- The abbreviation for reputation factions always starts with a "RP". After that it's normally the first letter of each word in the name of the reputation.
-- Important: Check if the abbreviation you want to use, has already been used. If that is the case, get creative ;)
- Add faction name to LoadPlayerReputation() in 'functionsCtr.lua'
-- Search for "LoadPlayerReputation"
-- Add the abbreviation to the RepOrder array
-- Look for the correct type (how many reputation levels, when do they change, name of the levels) in the RepTypes array. 
-- Then add the type to the RepType array. At the same position where you added the abbreviation in the RepOrder array. 
-- And don't forget the comma (RepOrder and RepType), TitanBar won't load without it.
- If you need to add a new reputation type
-- Add the names of the reputation levels to the localization files ("de", "en" and "fr").
--- Search for "All reputation standings" and add the new names to the end of the existing list.
--- For the abbreviation: They also start with a "RP". If the new type is only for one reputation, you can use the abbreviation of that reputation and then add a number for each level.
-- Add the reputation type to LoadPlayerReputation() in 'functionsCtr.lua'
--- Search for "LoadPlayerReputation"
--- Add the type to the RepTypes array
-- Add the reputation Points to ImportCtr() in 'functionsCtr.lua'
--- Search for "Reputation points"
--- Add the abbreviation of the faction name and the points where the reputation levels change
--- Search for "RPPROG = "default"" and add the new abbreviation in the if-statement under it
-- Add the reputation points to in 'ReputationToolTip.lua'
--- Search for "RPPROG = "default"" and add the new abbreviation in the if-statement under it


Add a new currency:
- Add  text names to the 'de', 'en', and 'fr' localization files
-- Search for "Wallet Currency Controls" and add the new currency to the end of the existing list
-- For the abbreviation: You need two for each currency. 
--- The first one starts with an "M" and then normally the first letter of each word in the name of the currency.
--- The second one starts normally with the first letter of each word in the name of the currency and then an "h".
--- Important: Check if the abbreviation you want to use, has already been used. If that is the case, get creative ;)
--- Important: The name behind the first abbreviation has to be exactly the name in the game (and most of the times singular). Otherwise it won't work.

- Add currency in 'main.lua'
-- Search for "WalletOrder" and add the next number to the array
-- Search for "PlayerAlign == 1" and add the abbreviation to the MenuItem array. The position in that array defines the order in which the currencies are listed.

- Add currency file in control directory
-- Copy an existing currency file (I mostly use "AnniversaryToken.lua")
-- Change the name of the file to the name of the new currency (as defined in the localization file, first abbreviation, no spaces between words).
-- Replace everything which is connected to the old currency (abbreviation, name, comments) with the new one (I use the replace all function of Notepad++).

- Add currency in 'TBressources.lua'
-- or more correctly: Add the image of the currency
-- Search for "_G.WalletItem"
-- Copy the last entry in the array and paste it as the last entry
-- Add a comma after the second to last entry (TitanBar won't load without it. It get's me every time)
-- Replace the name in the last entry with the new currency
-- Replace the hex value with the new icon value. (If you don't know the value scroll down to "HelloWorld-Plugin".

For each point after this: Search through the files and every time the existing currencies are listed, add the new currency.
- Add currency in 'functions.lua', in 'functionsCtr.lua', 'functionsMenuControl.lua, & in 'functionsMenu.lua'
- Add currency in 'settings.lua'
- Add currency in 'frmOptions.lua' & 'frmMain.lua'
- Add currency in 'background.lua'
- Add currency in 'WalletToolTip.lua' & 'WalletWindow.lua' (control directory)


To add a new control (from Technical_13):
- Add  text names to the 'de', 'en', and 'fr' localization files
- Add control in 'menu.lua'
- Add control in 'functions.lua', in 'functionsCtr.lua', 'functionsMenuControl.lua, & in 'functionsMenu.lua'
- Add control in 'settings.lua'
- Add control in 'frmOptions.lua'
- Add control in 'background.lua'
- Add control shell command in 'main.lua'
- Add control file in control directory


HelloWorld-Plugin
I needed the icons for some of the new currencies and after much frustration I found a way to get them with a second plugin (creatively named the "HelloWorld-Plugin").
The HelloWorld-Plugin lists all currencies with their icon-/image-number that you have in your wallet.
1. Open the following path: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins\
2. Create a new folder with the name "Duriel"
3. Open that folder. The complete path should be: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins\Duriel
4. Create a file with the name "HelloWorld.plugin"
5. Create a folder with the name "HelloWorld"
6. Open that folder. The complete path should be: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins\Duriel\HelloWorld
7. Create a file with the name "main.lua"
8. Copy the following code into the "HelloWorld.plugin" file. Then save the file.
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Plugin>
 <Information>
  <Name>HelloWorld</Name>
  <Author>Duriel</Author>
  <Version>1.00</Version>
 </Information>
 <Package>Duriel.HelloWorld.Main</Package>
 <Configuration Apartment="HelloWorld" />
</Plugin>
9. Copy the following code into the "main.lua" file. Then save the file.
import "Turbine.UI";
import "Turbine.UI.Lotro";
import "Turbine"
import "Turbine.Gameplay"

function print(text) Turbine.Shell.WriteLine("<rgb=#00FFFF>HW:</rgb> "..text) end

Player=Turbine.Gameplay.LocalPlayer:GetInstance();
PlayerWallet = Player:GetWallet();
PlayerWalletSize = PlayerWallet:GetSize();
for i = 1, PlayerWalletSize do
	CurItem = PlayerWallet:GetItem(i);
	CurName = CurItem:GetName();
	CurImage = CurItem:GetImage();
	--print(i .. "=" .. CurName)
	--print(i .. "=" .. CurImage)
	print(CurName .. " has image number " .. CurImage)
end
10. Login to Lotro
11. In the chat window type "/plugins list" (for German and French, scroll down to plugin commands). The HelloWorld-Plugin should be listed. If that is not the case, type "/plugins refresh" and then again "/plugins list"
	The plugins are listed in the "Standard" channel.
12. Type "/plugins load HelloWorld". You get a list with all currencies you have and the corresponding image number.
13. Find the currency, which you want to add, and copy / make a note of the number.
14. Open a hex converter of your choice (I use https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html)
15. Paste the number in the decimal field and convert it to hex.
16. Add the hex number to the "WalletItem" list in "TBResources.lua" (and remember to add that comma...)
17. Unload the HelloWorld-Plugin if you don't need it. Type "/plugins unload HelloWorld".

Plugin commands:
I found out the hard way that the commands you use to load and unload plugins depend on the language of the client. So here are some commands with the translations.
EN: "/plugins load <PluginName>, DE: "/Zusatzmodule laden <PluginName>", FR: "/plugins charger <PluginName>"
EN: "/plugins unload <PluginName>, DE: "/Zusatzmodule entfernen <PluginName>", FR: "/plugins vider <PluginName>"
EN: "/plugins list <PluginName>, DE: "/Zusatzmodule liste <PluginName>", FR: "/plugins liste <PluginName>"
EN: "/plugins refresh <PluginName>, DE: "/Zusatzmodule aktualisieren <PluginName>", FR: "/plugins actualiser <PluginName>"
