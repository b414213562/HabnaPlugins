Fanchen also tried to fix TitanBar currencies. See their progress at:
    https://github.com/Fanch3n/HabnaPlugins/tree/cleanup

TitanBar thoughts:
    Next:
        functions.lua AjustIcon(str) needs to handle currencies in a loop

    Next: function ImportCtr( value ) <= Change the parameter here from things like "MC" to "MithrilCoins".

Each Currency has two main keys associated:
	core abbreviation, e.g. "MC"
	settings name, e.g. "MithrilCoins"

    Places to change:
        sFrom can sometimes be Money instead of MI?!? WHY??!?!?!
        The Global variable is still named things like _G.MC, _G.SM, etc.
        Functions that take keys like "MC" as parameter:
            functions.lua ChangeColor(tColor), tColor
            functions.lua AjustIcon(str), str
        Any place we're using CurrencyCodeToKey or CurrencyKeyToCode
        All uses of _G.sFromCtr



Once the variables are made into a table,
that should allow for a lot of looping instead of stating every variable name.

The controls also populate tables, like this:
	_G.LAT = {}; -- Anniversary Token table in _G
In order that we stop polluting the global table,
	maybe put them in something like _G.TokenControls["LAT"].

change values of sFrom from things like "WI" to "Wallet". Then background.lua gets more straightforward.

Notes:
    Is WalletControl the generic thing I've been wanting to make?!?
    Reorder the items in functionsCtr.lua 
        function ImportCtr( value )
        to sort the wallet items together
    Do currencies need both Show and Where?
    If we can match up the currency icon to stuff in your wallet, do we even need the localized name?
    DecryptMoney and MoneyToCoins do essentially the same job. Combine them, and prefer the name MoneyToCoins.
    Commendations comments out this line. Is that correct? :
        --table["Icon"]:SetBlendMode( Turbine.UI.BlendMode.AlphaBlend );

Maybe fix how often we're using string.format for updating a setting?

LOTROPTS is different than LOTROPoints
