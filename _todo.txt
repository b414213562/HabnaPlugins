[DONE] Change key from friendly-names ("Wallet", "MithrilCoins", etc) to the image ID in preparation for arbitrary items.
    [DONE] Now that the 26 currencies are updated in my local save file, remove the progressive abilities of the v1.0 to v1.1 update code in settings.lua.

    Once that's done, can we kill all references to pre-defined lists of keys?

    Need to find code that uses things like CurrencyNameToKey and address how it uses those keys.
        Possibly fine?
    Can we store currency entries in PlayerCurrencyHandler by imageID?
    [DONE] Also: Character save files needs to be updated from key to id.
        [DONE] Converted plugindata files: Add "description" with old key.
    When adding new currencies to save file:
        Add "description" key with the WalletItem:GetName() value.
Are monster wallet items in the data files?
    If so, we should split them out, so that only monsters load those, and only free peoples load the others.

Consider if this is still good code in WalletToolTip.lua:
    if wttcur == Seals or wttcur == LOTROPoints then ttIcon:SetBackground( CtrIconCodeIs );

If we only show Commentations and LOTRO Points in Monster Play (See main.lua's MenuItem), why does this exist in frmMain.lua:
		-- Disable infos not useful in Monster Play
        for index, key in ipairs(CurrenciesNotUsedInMonsterPlay) do
            Show[key] = false;
        end

The Money tooltip (and maybe LotroPoints and Wallet) needs some attention - doesn't seem attached to the parent control.

Figure out how to include the C# file for generating the auto-generated files?
    Just add it to the data directory?

Consider not even adding treeview items for items not in wallet until the user asks, to improve loading time.

Fanchen also tried to fix TitanBar currencies. See their progress at:

Wallet window notes:
    Possible filters at the top: 
        Currencies with a cap.
        Currencies close to their cap.
        Account-wide Currencies, Personal Currencies, or both.


    Make changes to the current Wallet window, or have a Configure Wallet window?
    Maybe add a Show All button? This would eventually be replaced with a filter section?
    Or just hollow out the window contents and start adding tree items?
        This might need to wait until we get categories for each item.

Bug fix: The wallet window always responds to <enter> by clicking the save button.
    If we haven't opened up a currency's options, wcur is nil. Check for this in the enter handler,
    and set it back to nil once the save button's handler is done.
    This was a bug when I collapsed down the if wcur == X cases, because then the execution fell out of the if block without finding a match.

The way tooltip windows currently works:
    When the mouse cursor moves, hide the current window, nil out the only reference to it, and then create the window again from scratch.
    How it should work: If the window has the correct contents, just move it.\

Notes:
    Reorder the items in functionsCtr.lua 
        function ImportCtr( value )
        to sort the wallet items together
    Do currencies need both Show and Where?
    If we can match up the currency icon to stuff in your wallet, do we even need the localized name?
    DecryptMoney and MoneyToCoins do essentially the same job. Combine them, and prefer the name MoneyToCoins.
    Commendations comments out this line. Is that correct? :
        --table["Icon"]:SetBlendMode( Turbine.UI.BlendMode.AlphaBlend );

Maybe fix how often we're using string.format for updating a setting?

LOTROPTS is different than LOTROPoints
