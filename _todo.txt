Current bugs:
    Spend down to 0 issue: Because TitanBar ignores the passed value in favor of re-looking in the wallet,
        it probably is not finding it, and therefore doing nothing instead of counting that as "0".
        Possible fix: UpdateCurrency should take an optional quantity parameter. If present, use it.

        To test: in Midsummer festival, spend down tokens to 0, make sure we see that final change.

Question: Are we paying attention to these Wallet callbacks?
	ItemAdded	Event fired when an item is added to the wallet.
	ItemRemoved	Event fired when an item is removed from the wallet.
If not, why not?


TitanBar thoughts:
    Next: function ImportCtr( value ) <= Change the parameter here from things like "MC" to "MithrilCoins".

Each Currency has two main keys associated:
	core abbreviation, e.g. "MC"
	settings name, e.g. "MithrilCoins"

Once the variables are made into a table,
that should allow for a lot of looping instead of stating every variable name.

The controls also populate tables, like this:
	_G.LAT = {}; -- Anniversary Token table in _G
In order that we stop polluting the global table,
	maybe put them in something like _G.TokenControls["LAT"].

change values of sFrom from things like "WI" to "Wallet". Then background.lua gets more straightforward.

Notes:
    Is WalletControl the generic thing I've been wanting to make?!?
    Reorder the items in functionsCtr.lua 
        function ImportCtr( value )
        to sort the wallet items together
    Do currencies need both Show and Where?
    If we can match up the currency icon to stuff in your wallet, do we even need the localized name?
    DecryptMoney and MoneyToCoins do essentially the same job. Combine them, and prefer the name MoneyToCoins.
    Commendations comments out this line. Is that correct? :
        --table["Icon"]:SetBlendMode( Turbine.UI.BlendMode.AlphaBlend );

Maybe fix how often we're using string.format for updating a setting?

LOTROPTS is different than LOTROPoints
