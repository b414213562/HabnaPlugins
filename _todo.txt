Figure out how to include the C# file for generating the auto-generated files?
    Just add it to the data directory?
Populate extra items in the wallet window:
    Any currency in our wallet that isn't in the built-in list.
    Make a special category, like "Unknown to TitanBar", put them there.

Fanchen also tried to fix TitanBar currencies. See their progress at:
    https://github.com/Fanch3n/HabnaPlugins/tree/cleanup

Wallet window notes:
    Possible filters at the top: 
        Currencies with a cap.
        Currencies close to their cap.
        Account-wide Currencies, Personal Currencies, or both.


    Make changes to the current Wallet window, or have a Configure Wallet window?
    Maybe add a Show All button? This would eventually be replaced with a filter section?
    Or just hollow out the window contents and start adding tree items?
        This might need to wait until we get categories for each item.


    

TitanBar thoughts:

    Next: function ImportCtr( value ) <= Change the parameter here from things like "MC" to "MithrilCoins".

Each Currency has two main keys associated:
	core abbreviation, e.g. "MC"
	settings name, e.g. "MithrilCoins"

    Places to change:
        sFrom can sometimes be Money instead of MI?!? WHY??!?!?!
        The Global variable is still named things like _G.MC, _G.SM, etc.
        Functions that take keys like "MC" as parameter:
            functions.lua ChangeColor(tColor), tColor
            functions.lua AjustIcon(str), str
        Any place we're using CurrencyCodeToKey or CurrencyKeyToCode
        All uses of _G.sFromCtr

change values of sFrom from things like "WI" to "Wallet". Then background.lua gets more straightforward.

Notes:
    Reorder the items in functionsCtr.lua 
        function ImportCtr( value )
        to sort the wallet items together
    Do currencies need both Show and Where?
    If we can match up the currency icon to stuff in your wallet, do we even need the localized name?
    DecryptMoney and MoneyToCoins do essentially the same job. Combine them, and prefer the name MoneyToCoins.
    Commendations comments out this line. Is that correct? :
        --table["Icon"]:SetBlendMode( Turbine.UI.BlendMode.AlphaBlend );

Maybe fix how often we're using string.format for updating a setting?

LOTROPTS is different than LOTROPoints
