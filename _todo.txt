TitanBar thoughts:
    Next: function ImportCtr( value ) <= Change the parameter here from things like "MC" to "MithrilCoins".

Each Currency has two main keys associated:
	core abbreviation, e.g. "MC"
	settings name, e.g. "MithrilCoins"

Once the variables are made into a table,
that should allow for a lot of looping instead of stating every variable name.

The controls also populate tables, like this:
	_G.LAT = {}; -- Anniversary Token table in _G
In order that we stop polluting the global table,
	maybe put them in something like _G.TokenControls["LAT"].

change values of sFrom from things like "WI" to "Wallet". Then background.lua gets more straightforward.

Problems seen while working on this:
    Loading currencies results in an incorrect icon and no number. Loading TitanBar with them already present and it works.
    When moving money to tooltip, it stayed behind on bar as well until reload


Notes:
    Is WalletControl the generic thing I've been wanting to make?!?
    Reorder the items in functionsCtr.lua 
        function ImportCtr( value )
        to sort the wallet items together
    Do currencies need both Show and Where?
    If we can match up the currency icon to stuff in your wallet, do we even need the localized name?
    DecryptMoney and MoneyToCoins do essentially the same job. Combine them, and prefer the name MoneyToCoins.
    Commendations comments out this line. Is that correct? :
        --table["Icon"]:SetBlendMode( Turbine.UI.BlendMode.AlphaBlend );

Maybe fix how often we're using string.format for updating a setting?

LOTROPTS is different than LOTROPoints

Probably caused by my changes:

Seen 2024-04-30 on-stream:
    Start a fresh TitanBar experience (no save files), add Motes/Embers/Etc. to TitanBar, and they glitch out.
