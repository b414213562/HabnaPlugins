TitanBar thoughts:

Each Currency has two main keys associated:
	core abbreviation, e.g. "MC"
	settings name, e.g. "MithrilCoins"

The settings for each currency are copied to globals:
	ShowMithrilCoins
	MCbcAlpha
	MCbcRed
	MCbcGreen
	MCbcBlue
	_G.MCLocX
	_G.MCLocY
	_G.MCWhere
I'd like to put these into a table, like Show = {}, and Show[currencyKey] can genericize access.
	This might apply to more than currencies. That's probably ok?

Once the variables are made into a table,
that should allow for a lot of looping instead of stating every variable name.

The controls also populate tables, like this:
	_G.LAT = {}; -- Anniversary Token table in _G
In order that we stop polluting the global table,
	maybe put them in something like _G.TokenControls["LAT"].

Get rid of WalletOrder, it's not doing anything now, and makes things harder.

Maybe fix how often we're using string.format for updating a setting?
