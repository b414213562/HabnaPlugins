# HabnaPlugins
TitanBar for Lord of the Rings Online


This Lua Plugin was originaly created by Habna.

After a long absence,Thorondor2011 (https://github.com/Thorondor2011) assumed ownership and made a few updates...

18 months later Technical-13 (https://github.com/Technical-13) picked up maintaing the plugin and continued to do so until August 2020.

In April 2021 I, Duriel (https://github.com/Duriel908), started to maintain the plugin.
You can find it on LOTRO interfaces: https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info1140-TitanBar.html

Feel free to download and tinker with the code.

Thanks!
